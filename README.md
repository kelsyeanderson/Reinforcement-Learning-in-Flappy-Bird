The majority of this code was taken from Neven Piƒçuljan's dqn_flappy_bird repository (https://github.com/nevenp/dqn_flappy_bird). I modified it to add difficulty levels to our environment, added graphs to be able to better track how quickly our agent was learning/performing after it was trained, and added three more CNN models you could test your agents on. I've also included my final report with my conclusions as well as my presentation slides.
